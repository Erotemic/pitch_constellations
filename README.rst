Pitch Constellations
====================

This is a small visualization I wrote for fun in 2013. I found it again in
2021 and wow, I've come a long way as a software engineer.

I haven't changed much from the original 2013 implementation. The code is still
pretty messy, but I was compelled to port it to Python 3, lint it, and remove
``from ? import *`` statements. I also added this README which demos the
visualization. The code was never pretty, but the matplotlib figures were. 


.. The large version wont work because github strips rst image rescaling.

Ok, well the big one doesn't render well, but I do like each individual
constellation, even after 8 years.
